Sample of a piece of code

I chose this piece of code because it's one of the most memorable ones I've written. 
It was during a project where I first learned about handling multiple operations atomically in a client-server application. 
I was working on a web store example, specifically managing a shopping cart here. 
When a customer attempted to make a purchase, I had to ensure all items in the cart were still available on the server before proceeding. 
This was crucial for being able to roll back any changes if any items were unexpectedly unavailable.
